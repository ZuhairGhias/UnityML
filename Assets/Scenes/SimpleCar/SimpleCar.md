## Logs

* 1/21/2020 - First successful barin. After adjusting things like batch size, 
learning rate, curiosity reward, vector observations, reward scheme for the 
past few days, not much success. Came back today and ran learning without any
changes, and I actually got a successful NN model. Is this the effect of local
minima in gradient descent?

* 1/22/2020 - Ran training with the same configuration unsuccessfully.
Further convinced this has to do with local minima in gradient descent.
